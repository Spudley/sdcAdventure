The files in this folder are for the small demo game provided with sdcAdventure.

This demo game serves a few purposes:

* To allow you to try out sdcAdventure with the minimum of effort.
* To allow me to test new code as I write it.

The demo game is not set up by default. If you attempt to run sdcAdventure immediately after loading the files, you will get a database error. To set up the demo game, go to the designer program, and click the "Setup Demo" button.

Some of the characters, concepts and graphics in this demo game are derived from work by Mark Stanley in his Freefall comic strip (http://freefall.purrsia.com). (I originally intended to just write a game based on the comic (an early version was releaed as a Windows exe and linked by Mark on the Freefall site), but I ended up writing a game writing platform instead)
