sdcAdventure  --  A development project by Simon Champion.


A PHP/Javascript -based system for creating point+click adventure games, in the vein of Monkey Island, but running in a browser.

Includes a game designer and a game playing engine.


Important: WIP
--------------
This project is very much a work-in-progress at the moment. Large parts of the intended functionality is still incomplete. Right now it should be seen more at a proof-of-concept than a finished system.



Playing A Game
--------------
Anyone who has played the old Sierra or Lucasfilm games, or other similar games should find the gameplay here familiar.

The screen is divided into a large panel for the scene and a smaller panel at the bottom with a group of buttons for the actions.

The default action is "Walk to".

Clicking in the scene area performs the current action. So for "Walk to", clicking in the scene will move your character to that point, assuming you are allowed to move there.
Selecting "Talk to" allows you to click on other characters and start a conversation. The options for things to say will appear in the button panel.

The aim of the game is to explore. Walking around and talking to people will give you clues as to what you need to do next.



Writing A Game
--------------
The first thing you'll need to write a game is an idea for the game and some graphics for it. I can't help you with that, but there are a few things to know:

* In the current version, you should keep your scene backdrops to 640 x 480 pixels.
* Character animations are created as a single sprite graphic, with multiple images. The size of each image should be the same. You can specify the sprite size in the character designer.

The game designer gives you list windows for Scenes, Characters and Items. From these lists you can add, edit and delete.

Adding and editing will open another window with the editable details.

* Scenes
The scene designer allows you to upload a scene background graphic, and specify the scene name.
It also has tabs where you can edit the walkable areas and the exits by defining shapes for them over the top of the background graphic.

* Characters

* Items


Development
-----------

* Todo:
- Items. Nothing much done with Items yet. Inventory, item designer, etc.
- Conversations. Needs to be more flexible.
- Ability to alter state of game as user progresses. Currently all you can do is keep repeating the same things.
- Lots and lots more.


_Overall Design_

Key elements:
* Scenes (locations)
  - walkable areas [DONE]
  - exits to other scenes [DONE]
  - a background graphic [done]
  - optional layered graphics, so the characters can move behind items of scenery. (alternatively, those items of scenery could be loaded as 'items'; this has the advantage that the click to learn more aspect is the same as other items, but the downside is that it would be less intuitive in the designer)
* Characters
  - sprite graphics for animating walking, talking, picking up, plus anything else they need to do. [DONE]
  - character conversation trees. [DONE]
  - every character (and object) needs a layer depth (z-index) value so we can layer things correctly.
  - Moving characters should alter their z-index according to their location on the screen.
  - 
* Objects
  - scene graphic
  - inventory graphic
  - location (scene and position within scene)
  - actions player can perform on object
  - 
* Player control
  - point+click to move character [DONE]
  - pick things up
  - use object
  - talk to character [DONE]
  -
* Designer interface
  - CRUD scenes
  - CRUD characters
  - CRUD objects
  -

* Playing
  - game context stored in PHP session.
  - save game.
